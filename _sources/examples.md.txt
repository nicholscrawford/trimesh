# Examples
Several examples are available as rendered IPython notebooks.

### [shortest.ipynb](examples.shortest.html)
Given a mesh and two vertex indices find the shortest path between the two vertices while only traveling along edges of the mesh using a distance-weighted graph search.

### [curvature.ipynb](examples.curvature.html)
An example of the discrete gaussian curvature measure.

### [texture.ipynb](examples.texture.html)
Load and display a mesh with UV coordinates and texture images.

### [ray.ipynb](examples.ray.html)
An example showing simple ray-mesh queries.

### [integrate.ipynb](examples.integrate.html)
An example of running integration on a mesh surface.

### [section.ipynb](examples.section.html)
A demonstration of mesh-plane cross-sections, commonly referred to as "slicing" in the context of 3D printing.

### [quick_start.ipynb](examples.quick_start.html)
A simple example showing various properties of `Trimesh` objects.

### [colors.ipynb](examples.colors.html)
A simple example of loading and displaying a mesh with face colors.

### [nearest.ipynb](examples.nearest.html)
An example showing nearest point queries, sampling the volume of box primitives generated from the oriented bounds and using PointCloud objects for visualization.
